Score Calculator
    The app must ask how many players there are and then allow me to enter each player's score individually.
        - Model: 15 mins
        - UI: 2 hours

    The app should know the individual scores in the future, so that I can later go back and see or edit the individual scores.
        - UI: +1 hours

    The computation for the achievement level is still based on the sum of all player scores.
        - Model: 15 mins

Achievement Improvements
    When a game is played and an achievement level is earned, I want an image, some animation effect,
    and a sound to be played to make it feel like a reward and a celebration.
        - UI: 4 hours

    I want to select a theme for the achievements. I want at least 3 different themes to choose between.
        - Model: 2 hours
        - UI: 5+ hours
