Unit of Work - An hour of coding / debugging, not including research

    - 1 - 2 units of work because one of the team members did a similar thing for Game Categories

Score Calculator
    The app must ask how many players there are and then allow me to enter each player's score individually.
        - Model: 1/4 units of work
        - UI: 2 units of work

    The app should know the individual scores in the future, so that I can later go back and see or edit the individual scores.
        - UI: more than 1 unit of work

    The computation for the achievement level is still based on the sum of all player scores.
        - Model: 1/4 units of work

Achievement Improvements
    When a game is played and an achievement level is earned, I want an image, some animation effect,
    and a sound to be played to make it feel like a reward and a celebration.
        - UI: 4 units of work

    I want to select a theme for the achievements. I want at least 3 different themes to choose between.
        - Model: 2 units of work
        - UI: 5+ units of work
